This is my graduation work about malware analysis with computer vision and behavioural analysis with cuckoo sandbox

I'm still working, so full methodology and ready-to-use server with all scripts will appear shortly

For now:
dll_downloader - some scripts for automatically crawl web-site contains lots of non-malicious dll files for "benign" dataset

http_server - main core of project, and main "headache" at this moment, it implies tensorflow integration with cuckoo sandbox interaction

model - resnetV50 weights trained with transfer learning and validated for about 98% of successful malware detection

scripts - some additional scripts for different purposes, some kiddie users may find it useful

pictures - pictures for research contains not much info now (will be added after research publication)
